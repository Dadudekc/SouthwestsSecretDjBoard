## Overview

This project is a basic Virtual DJ application tailored specifically for chopping and screwing music. It includes essential features like pitch control, flanger effects, and brake start/stop to create that signature sound. This code serves as a starting point for further development and experimentation in the genre of chopped and screwed music.

## Features

- **Pitch Control:** Adjust the speed of the track to achieve the classic "screwed" sound.
- **Flanger Effect:** Adds a sweeping, jet-plane sound to the track.
- **Brake Start/Stop:** Emulates the sound of a turntable slowing down suddenly.
- **Playback Control:** Start and stop playback of the track.
- **Modular Design:** The code is designed to be easily extensible, allowing for additional effects and features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
- **Pydub**: A simple and easy-to-use library for audio processing in Python.
- **Simpleaudio**: A cross-platform audio library for Python.

You can install the required Python packages using pip:


pip install pydub simpleaudio


Usage
Clone the Repository:



git clone https://github.com/DaDudeKC/SouthwestsSecretDjBoard.git
cd virtual-dj-chopped-screwed

Prepare Your Audio File:

Place your audio file in the project directory. Update the file path in the virtual_dj_backend.py script.
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python virtual_dj_backend.py
This will load the audio file, apply pitch control, and play the track with the configured effects.
Example
The provided code demonstrates how to:

Load an audio file.
Apply pitch control to slow down the track.
Apply a basic flanger effect.
Play the track with the applied effects.
Future Development
This project is open for contributions. Here are some ideas for future enhancements:

Add More Effects: Implement more audio effects specific to chopped and screwed music.
Develop a UI: Build a user-friendly interface for easier control and manipulation of tracks.
